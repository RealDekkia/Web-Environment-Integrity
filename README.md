# Web Enshittification Integrity API

This repository details the proposal to add a new API that makes the web even more ass than it already is:

```js
const attestation = await navigator.getEnvironmentIntegrity("...");
```

The [explainer](./explainer.md) goes gives a high level overview of the shit we're trying to pull.

The [spec](https://rupertbenwiser.github.io/Web-Environment-Integrity/) currently describes how this crap is being prototyped in Chromium.
